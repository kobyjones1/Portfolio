            <p>Yo! I'm Koby. A full-stack software engineer based in Las Vegas. </p>
            <p>I started programming in 2016, then I went to College of the Albemarle in 2017 to get my Associate's degree in computer programming.</p>
            <p>Originally, I wanted to become a video game programmer, but then I began pursuing full-stack software engineering when I realized video game programming wasn't as fulfilling as full-stack development.</p>
            <p>I enjoy watching anime and playing video games when I'm not working on developing my software engineering skills and projects.</p>
